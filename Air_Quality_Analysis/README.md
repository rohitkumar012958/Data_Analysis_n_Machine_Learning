# Air Quality Analysis across The World¶
## Goal
To Conduct a comprehensive global data analysis to identify regions with the cleanest and dirtiest air quality, focusing on key parameters such as overall Air Quality Index (AQI), Carbon Dioxide AQI, Ozone AQI, and Nitrogen Dioxide AQI.
The objective is to discern and rank regions based on air quality, identifying both the cleanest and dirtiest areas worldwide.
The motivation behind the analysis is the growing concerns of impacts of air pollution on health and environment. Ensuring clean and healthy air is crucial for the well-being of communities globally.
Leveraging advanced analytics, this study aims to offer insights into the geographical distribution of air pollution, facilitating the development of strategic environmental policies and targeted public health initiatives on a global scale.
